### How to set up:
You will need to install [Composer]("https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md"), scroll down to the part where it says windows installation.

Download and run the installer or run the manual install, make sure you have the [php CLI in your PATH]("https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31291317/php-is-not-recognized-as-an-internal-or-external-command-in-command-prompt") variable. 
Also make sure you have the [composer CLI in your PATH]("https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm") variable.
Once you have installed Composer, run `composer install` in the project directory to install the dependencies in this project.

Now run `php server.php` in a terminal in the project directory to run the websocket server. You can now connect to the websocket.
